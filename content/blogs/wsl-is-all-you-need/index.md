Coding on Windows feels like a nightmare, but I cannot play most games on Linux, and I hate MacOS from many aspects.

After trying many solutions, now I firmly believe that WSL (as a Docker launcher ðŸ¤£) is the best solution if:

- You are a programmer specifically relying on Unix environment, for example, Deep Learning, CUDA, C++, etc.
- You are a gamer who wants to play games on Windows.
- You want to switch between Linux and Windows with zero cost.

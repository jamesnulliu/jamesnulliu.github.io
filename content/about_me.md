Hello, I am JamesNULLiu (ÂàòÂΩ¶Ëæ∞).

I am a 4th-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science in Shanghai University, now working as an intern in [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn), mainly engaged in **inference acceleration**, **graph optimization** and **reasoning** of Large Language Models.

I am a **passionate programmer** and an **open-source enthusiast**. As the principal maintainer of [Shanghai University Super-Computing Team](https://SHUSCT.github.io/wiki) and an active contributor to [Shanghai University Open-Source Community](https://github.com/shuosc), my programming expertise encompasses **C++**, **Python**, **CUDA**, **LLVM/MLIR**, **PyTorch/libtorch**, ......

I am also a **researcher** in the field of **High Performance Computing**, **Large Language Models** and **In-vehicle Network Security**. I have published several papers in these areas, looking forward to further research opportunities.

If you have any inquiries or are interested in collaboration, please feel free to contact me via email at jamesnulliu@gmail.com.
